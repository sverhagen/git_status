# Git Status

Git Status is a simple Python script to evaluate a folder with Git repositories for their current working status, it
will show whether repositories need work (such as pushing code, commiting changes, and so on). It has helped me keep
track of a sprawling number of microservice and other repositories.

## Installation

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
